## About this project
An application to search for and find a song by it's lyric. 
The application collects information from external APIs [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com/).

The application is using [react](https://reactjs.org/) framework and external libraries:
* [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
* [react-modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal)
* [Bootstraps](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Comparison between JS-frameworks
## React
We chose to work with React for this project. All of the team members used React for the previous assignment and felt that there were still a lot to learn about React. On the job market there seemed to be a high demand for experience using React. It is widely used with lots of examples and help online for when we needed that and it played a part in us choosing React.

## Angular
Large framework with what we perceived as a steep learning curve. The amount of features seemed excessive in relation to the scale of our project and we wanted to quickly get started and have the application up and running.

## Vue
If we didn´t use React we probably would have chosen Vue. In relation to React it seemed to have roughly the same learning curve and complexity. Usage of Vue is on the rise but not quite on the level of React (for the time being). The deciding factor to use React was the amount of online example and guidance in favor of React and the teams prior usage of React led us to feel more comfortable continuing use and learn React.
